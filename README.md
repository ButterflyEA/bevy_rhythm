# Bevy Rhythm

This project is an updated implementation of the Bevy rhythm tutorial originally created by guimcaballero, adapted to work with the latest version of Bevy. The original tutorial was developed using Bevy 0.4, and significant changes have been introduced to the Bevy framework since its initial release.
